# KenyaEMR esm core

This repository contains frontend modules for the KenyaEMR. These modules relate to display patient-flags. The modules within this repository include:

- [Patient flags](packages/esm-patient-flags-app/)

## Setup

Check out the developer documentation [here](http://o3-dev.docs.openmrs.org).

This monorepo uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

To install the dependancies, run:
```bash
npx lerna bootstrap
```

To start a dev server running all the modules simultaneously, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

This command uses the [openmrs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openmrs) tooling to fire up a dev server running `esm-patient-chart` as well as the specified module.

Note that this is very resource-intensive.

To start a dev server for a specific module, run:

```bash
yarn start --sources 'packages/esm-<insert-package-name>-app'
```

You could provide `yarn start` with as many `sources` arguments as you require. For example, to run the patient registration and patient search modules only, use:

```bash
yarn start --sources 'packages/esm-patient-flags-app'
```
